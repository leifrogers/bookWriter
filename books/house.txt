research. In addition
to the construction material, the process must also contain methods for
checking rule
application during the process and in the resulting model. In summary,
the process
involves qualitative and quantitative methods for evaluating and testing
the process and
resulting model.

*Reconstructing Palladio’s Villas:*
/*8 */
The process used here is done in a series of steps starting with a
/villa manual /and
concluding with a three-dimensional representation known as a /villa
model/. The villa
manual is a clarification of rules from the /Four Books, /by rewriting
and illustrating each
rule in the form of a simple line of text. This manual contains all of
the programming,
construction and ornamental rules needed to reconstruct a villa from a
site plan. The first
step is to reconstruct the site plan of the villa and the barns, in form
of a line drawing a
process similar to Palladio’s sketch representations not found in the
/Four Books /(fig.5).
The second step is to apply construction rules to the line
representation of the plan in
order to create a digital representation of Palladio’s design
intensions. The third step is to
reconstruct a digital representation of the elevation from the previous
digital plan and the
elevation drawing in the /Four Books/. Finally, three dimensional
/construction rules /and
/ornamental rules /are applied to the plan and elevation drawings
leading to a /villa model/
representing of half of the final villa (fig. 10). The villa model is
used to create plans,
sections and elevation drawings for measurements in addition to a three
dimensional print
and renderings of complex spaces. Throughout the process each rule taken
from the villa
manual, or rule invented by the author or others is recorded on a
spreadsheet. (see:
Appendix-A)

*3.1 *
*Reconstructing the floor plan *
This reconstruction system is a set of parametric shapes, systematically
applied to the
plan diagram (fig. 5) once the proportions and general shape of the plan
has been
constructed (fig. 6). The construction system is used to create a
finished plan of walls,
ceilings, porticos and stairs. These shapes are plan views of
construction items and new
rules created by the author. New rules must be written to fill the gaps
for general rules
written by Palladio. They are scalable, stretchable images representing
design and
construction rule sets that are dependant on the completion of the
previous set of objects
on the plan for their parametric assignment. For example, villa wall
thickness is defined
by the ceiling type assigned to the plan, if a room has a heavier
ceiling then the walls
must be thicker. If a lighter ceiling type, such as wood joist are used
they require a
thinner wall thickness. But door or window placement does not depend on
wall thickness;
it is dependent on room adjacency and views to the outside world. So,
wall thickness
cannot be assigned to the plan until the ceiling type is defined on the
plan diagram. The
process requires the assignment of nine steps each with a series of
rules from the villa
manual that can be applied to the plan. The final representation is a
quantitative
representation from Palladio’s plan drawing in the Four Books.

*Reconstructing the Elevation *
Palladio's elevations are pictorial representations of the plan,
projecting and adding
elements from the *piano noble*. A closer look at the plan and
elevations demonstrates that
two drawings don’t match. Lines are off or sometimes drawn differently
from the plan all
together. The elevation design sketch is transformed to a digital
representation in nine
steps, each focused on representing some aspect of the construction,
such as wall height
variation and column location. Most are focused on a pictorial
representation of the parts
by locating windows, doors, pediments, moldings and entablatures. Each
step listed
below for this system was taken from a survey of villa drawings in book
two of the
/Quattro Libri/. Most steps in this section are symbolic notations that
can be applied to the
initial wall shape. Most of shapes for the elevation reconstruction are
fixed
representations or symbols used to locate the objects on the elevation.
Finished sizes are
not of the highest concern here the goal is to create a pictorial
reference for heights and
symbolic location.

*Constructing the Villa Model *
The /Queen Anne Grammar/
/5/
and the /*Frank Lloyd Wright* Grammars/
/6/
use parametric
grammars used to specify shapes in the styles of the architects. The
difficulty with the use
of these grammars here is that the origin of the sizes for the shapes is
unclear. There is
little documentation defining the sizes of the objects and the reasoning
behind their
fitness requirements. To address the issue, this study has created a
spreadsheet containing
variables missing from Palladio’s drawings.
There are twelve steps toward constructing the final villa model. Each
step requires sizing
and location information from the reconstructed plan and elevation
drawings. Just as with
the Queen Anne grammar, a building part is assigned a set of variables
also listed on the
spreadsheet from rule variables defined in the villa manual. The rule
application
developed here is not formed from many pre made objects that are
combined to make a
final product, but formed from procedures and profiles designed in the
Palladian style.

*Villa Manual of Rules*
The /Four Books of Architecture /breaks rules up by object, proportion
and spatial
ordering. Text rule representation in the text and application to a
reconstruction can be
confusing, the text was meant to be read by a 16
th
century mason or architect. The villa
manual is broken into 16 sections based on vicenzentine brick, means of
measuring,
objects such as columns and mathematical rules such as ceiling height or
window
opening sizes. Within each section of the manual is a rewriting of the
rule from the /Four /
/Books /or a new rule needed to construct a detail or a space not
mentioned in Palladio’s
text. A typical series of rules from the villa manual are written in the
following format:
RULES FOR STAIRS (fig. 9)
8.1.pa - Staircases may not obstruct other places, nor be obstructed by them
7
8.2.1.pa - They should be hidden from those that enter the house
8
8.2.2.pa - They should be in a place so that the most beautiful part of
the house is seen first
9
8.3.1.pa - Three openings are required in staircases
10
The number on the right of the rules indicates the rules section, and
rule division within
that section. The “pa” refers to a rule written by Palladio. A rule
labeled “ls” or “sm”
means that the rule was author by someone else. Within the text rule
representation and
application can be confusing and hard to apply. In this study the manual
of rules is based
on three rule types: /plan programming rules/, /construction rules /and
/ornamental rule/.
*Fig. *9 Rules for a stair construction. D = riser height & brick
thickness, tr = tread
depth
------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Page 16*
*Reconstructing Palladio’s Villas:*
/*16 */
*4.1 *
*Input - Plan Programming Rules *
/Plan programming /rules are spatial, two-dimensional rules used to
construct or
reconstruct any plan (with some degree of accuracy) by rule and
proportion in line form.
These rules organize the plan from the site, to wall and stair layout.
Two examples of
/plan programming /rules are those used to organize the loggias and
internal spaces by
Palladian rule. First, Palladio says that “the loggias, halls, courts
and magnificent rooms
as principal spaces.”
11
Second, that these principle spaces should be seen first (halls) and
the secondary spaces should be hidden from view (stairs, kitchens,
servant areas).
12
Based on these rules a villa will never have a grand internal staircase
at the entry. There
are 15 /plan programming rules /taken from the original text that can be
used to
reconstruct most villa plans. I also added eight additional rules
simplifying and filling in
missing gaps from the text. For example the floor plans found in the
text confuse the
issue of room size, some historians say that the dimensions listed on
Palladio’s floor
plans refer to dimensions from face of wall to face of wall.
Unfortunately Palladio’s
drawings vary in representation. When the dimensions are added to define
the plan sizes
they never amount to a consistent rule based on measurements from face
of wall to face
of wall, or center of wall to center of wall. The rule here defines room
sizes from center
of wall to center of wall, adding wall thickness later. The final floor
plan and barn plan is
represented by a series of line similar to Wittkower’s study. In summary
/plan /
/programming rules /organize the floor plan by Palladian rule from the
site to the stairs in
line form (fig. 5).
The order of application begins with site rules followed by loggia
rules, and last are
spatial rules used for room layout and ceiling height proportions,
starting with principle
spaces. For example, site rules used to reconstruct the a villa say;
“the house should be
placed in a convenient location in the middle of the site.”
13
Second “the barns may not be
an impediment to any other part of the main house”, thus they are placed
at the perimeter
of the site. Third, the steward and bailiff should be placed near the
outer gate for safety,
creating dovecotes and a large fence at the villas entrance completing
the barn assembly
(fig 5).
14
Rules for the main house also follow the /plan programming /process by
placing
the loggia at the front of the villa. The first space entered is a
magnificent barrel vaulted
hall, and the stairs are out of view, while the nicest rooms are at the
front of the villa, the
smaller lesser rooms are towards the back. The final plan (fig.5) is a
line representation
based on dimensions from the original drawing, prepared for construction
details and
information.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Page 17*
*Reconstructing Palladio’s Villas:*
/*17 */
*4.2 *
*Input - Construction Rules *
The second set of rules are /construction rules /applied to the line
drawing to create a
functional floor plan followed by an elevation drawing from which three
dimensional
villa model can be constructed. The construction rules are applied the
floor plan line
drawings to define wall thickness, stair sizes, and true window and door
locations (fig 6).
Construction rules are also used to create the elevation, accurately.
Rules are given by
Palladio to define the outer shell of the elevation drawing (fig. 7 -
1-boundaries).
Construction rules are used to define the cornice, column types and roof
slope. The final
representation in the plan and elevation is a representation of the
drawing from the /Four /
/Books/, each reconstruction in nine steps. Most important is that the
digital representation
demonstrates conflicts in the relationship of the plan to the elevation.
For example the
bumped out areas of the plan are not represented in the elevation.
Columns may be too
thick to allow a person to pass through the portico comfortably in
elevation, when they fit
perfectly in the plan. These two dimensional conflicts are resolved
within the three
dimensional reconstruction.
*4.3 *
*Input - Ornamental Rules *
The final rule type in the villa manual are ornamental rules applied to
complex areas or
surfaces in order to cover imperfections in construction, or to set a
particular design
feature apart from another (window moldings, column capitols, etc.).
There are some
rules written for the construction of an ornament in the /Four Books
/such as doorframes,
window moldings and column moldings, but there are few rules that state
the conditions
under which they should be applied.
*5.0 *
*Output - Representation *
The case studies are a presentation using four methods of representation
and evaluation,
each method addressing both qualitative and quantitative issues.
15
These representational
methods address Schon's points on action-in-reflection in that this
process is one of
learning by doing.
16
Here the four methods include rule graphs, also known as
spreadsheets, used record object variables and rule equations, 3D
printing of the model
file followed (fig. 11) by 2D documentation and finally rendering used
to visualize areas
of spatial conflict. The concept of representation is that the more
opportunities offered to
visualize the design, the better the design results. Filmmakers and
artists follow a similar
process by changing the viewer's position in relation to the artificial
world with devices
from stereoscopic glasses to virtual reality. Their mission is to
visually engage the viewer
in the subject matter by changing the viewer’s point in relationship to
the object being
viewed.
17
In this study, rendering and model making tools as output materials from a
------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Page 18*
*Reconstructing Palladio’s Villas:*
/*18 */
CAD file are used to create different architectural perspectives from a
variety output
materials.
*5.1 *
*Output - One-Dimensional Representation *
One-dimensional output refers to the graph presentation (spreadsheet) of
text rules used
to build each villa model (found in the appendixes of the previous two
chapters). They
are accompanied by graphic descriptions, but are not meant to serve as a
substitute for the
geometric material.
18
Each graph contains the rule, the element upon which the rule is
applied and a reference number for pointing to the rules definition. The
rules in the graph
serve as text functions used to determined shapes from room size to
column depth or
mathematical formulas used to determine window heights, room heights or
Principal door
sizes. This method of presenting textural rules along with the graphic
representation is
similar to a method used to describe shape grammars where the element is
described
along side its function.
19
Text representation in this study will be used as a quantitative
means for evaluating the villa models.
*Fig. *10 Cad representation of the completed Villa Cornaro vila model
------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Page 19*
*Reconstructing Palladio’s Villas:*
/*19 */
*5.2 *
*Output- Two-Dimensional Representation *
Two-dimensional output refers to conventional drawing - plans, sections
and elevations,
used as comparative tools for evaluating the villa model against other
drawings, such
those of Bertotti Scamozzi. Plans are cut four feet above the finished
floor. Sections are
taken at the mid-point of both axes and elevations are taken at the
extent of the property
lines. A bar scale and a north arrow accompany each drawing when
necessary. These
drawings are a quantitative means of representing the villa model.
*5.3 *
*Three-Dimensional Representation*
Three-dimensional output refers to physical model output from machines
in the form of
plastic or cornstarch. Three-dimensional printing or Fuse Deposition
Modeling (FDM)
stands as the moment of truth in CAD modeling and detail. Mistakes
created by
miscalculations in the creation of the CAD file, reveal themselves once
printed in three
dimensions. The output process is similar to conventional printing with
the exception of
the material and the output platform. The villa model or CAD file is cut
into many plan-
sections at intervals of 1/100 of an inch per section. Each plan-section
represents one
print file. Each plan-section file is sent to the printer one layer at a
time and printed upon
the previous layer. The final output is in the form of a plastic or
cornstarch three-
dimensional object. The final model has a maximum size of 10" x 10" x
10" per part.
Large models are printed in pieces and glued together. Because the villa
can be printed at
any scale it stands as both a qualitative and quantitative means of
representation (fig.11).
*5.4 *
*Renderings *
Renderings are used to simulate various design conditions such as
lighting, surface
textures and form while placing the viewer inside of the space.
Rendering output here is
focused on design issues and not on representing the full building. In
most cases, the
issue is about the lighting conditions of a space or the formal
qualities of an outdoor
space, such as a loggia. Each study uses geometric models of a
particular space, the only
areas modeled are those in relation with the issue. Renderings are used
here to
qualitatively evaluate interior spaces and some exterior forms.
The rendering process uses radiosity models, whose surfaces are texture
mapped and
raytraced. In order to save on computer processing time, the full CAD
file is copied, and
areas not within the view of the rendering camera are erased from the
file. The goal is to
create a stage set of geometric surfaces from the villa model, upon
which textures can be
applied. The process starts with a solid geometry file, which is
translated to a facial
------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Page 20*
*Reconstructing Palladio’s Villas:*
/*20 */
representation. All solid information is removed model to be rendered.
In other words the
only geometry translated from the CAD representation to the radiosity
program contains
the geometry of the space and adjacent spaces within the frame of the
camera.
Texture maps (taken from photos of existing villas) are used to create
surfaces similar to
those in the built conditions. These maps allow the viewer to evaluate
rendered images on
that architect's terms. This means the walls appear to be the walls that
were built by that
architect. High-resolution texture maps are applied to each geometric
surface within the
frame of the camera. When rendering ideal day lighting conditions are
needed to define
surface texture, color and smoothness. The goal is to infuse the model
or space with just
enough light so as not to over or under illuminate a surface, which
creates dark patches in
detailed areas. The lighting goal is to offer just enough to create a
contrast in surfaces.
The final step is to raytrace the radiosity model and texture mapped
surfaces, resulting in
a high-resolution image

*Case study a: reconstructing The Villa Trissino, Meledo*
This chapter is a presentation of four attempts to reconstruct the
un-built villa Trissino in
Meledo (fig. 12) reflecting how the villa would have been built using
the rules in the villa
manual. The three previous reconstruction attempts were evaluated in
rendering or 3D
print form only. Each result from the studies differed slightly based on
different
interpretations of the rules by different people. The first attempt, was
part of the simple
representations constructed for a CD-Rom project (fig 3). The villa
model had no
interiors or detail such as column or cornice moldings. The second
reconstruction was
undertaken in a workshop the following year. Students reconstructed
parts of the villa,
later combining those parts to create a full villa model. The final
results were composed
of interior and exterior renderings and a three-dimensional printed
model. There were no
attempts to record decisions or a documentation of the final model. The
third version,
completed by Isaac Persley an undergraduate architectural student, was a
research project
focused on building by the rules and recording the steps in graphic and
textural form. The
rules used in this study were recorded on a spreadsheet along with a
drawing file defining
the application of the rule visually in the form of step-by-step
pictorial documentation. It
was also printed three-dimensionally. The fourth and final version was
created using
methods defined in this paper. There are one, two and three-dimensional
records of all
decisions used to reconstruct the villa model as well as a
three-dimensional print and
renderings of the central space.
*Fig. *12 Palladio's plan of the villa Trissino in Meledo
------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Page 22*
*Reconstructing Palladio’s Villas:*
/*22 */
The existing site for the Villa Trissino contains two dovecotes and
parts of the lower
barns and a stone fence. It has been debated whether the designs of the
barns are
Palladio's, or that of a lesser architect.
20
History has it that the villa was never constructed
and that Palladio never designed the existing dovecotes. As described by
Palladio, the
main house sits atop a beautiful hill over looking farms and small
waterways.
21
The villa
itself is similar in design as that of the Rotunda, a suburban villa
with a circular hall and
adjacent hall spaces. The Villa Trissino in Meledo combines a sense of
dramatic theater
like that of the Villa Rotunda, with the workings of a true farm like
that of the Villa
Pojana Maggore
22
Staying true to his rules, Palladio places the villa atop the highest
point on the site from which barns cascade down and around to it’s outer
ends.
To start, the reconstruction an initial grid (a & b) for the main house
was placed atop the
hill along with a barn grid at a lower point. These grids are used to
define the spacing of
the walls and columns. The measurements for the villa plan where taken
from Palladio's
drawing (fig. 13), while the barn grid was an interpretation of the
dimensions (fig. 14)
from the drawing-there are no measured drawings of any kind for this
building. The barns
are divided into two sections, one circular and the other half square.
There are two
methods that could be used to find the center point of the circular
barns. The first method
is to add the distance between the columns and the diameter of the
column defining the
barn circumference.
*Fig. *13 Site plan of the Villa
Trissino with grid-a and grid-b
*Fig. *14 Grids-a and grid-b
------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Page 23*
*Reconstructing Palladio’s Villas:*
/*23 */
The second is to measure the distance from the edge of the steps leading
to the lower
terrace to the first column in the circular barn. The length of the barn
is found by adding
the columns and their diameters. I had to refer to Bertotti Scamozzi's
drawing for the
number of columns and the spacing between the columns to define the
length of the
barns. The villa barns also sit alongside of a thin waterway, specified
in Palladio's
description of the villa.
23
*6.1 *
*The Reconstruction *
One
fundamental problem with the Palladio's drawing is that one of the side
rooms is
missing a dimension note needed to define the width of the room space
and the adjacent
run of the stairs. Palladio provides the length (30ft.) but not the
width. This dimension
defines the overall size of the space, and it helps to define the shape
and ordering of the
stair. It is possible that the width of the space could be a ratio such
as 2:1 (15'), or 3:5 that
would make the missing dimension 18'. Both numbers are too small to
create the adjacent
flight of stairs that would clear the doors below. The proposal here
calls for the space to
be 22' wide, which should clear the door if there is a winding stair
(fig. 15).
*Fig. *15 Two solutions for the missing dimension. Scheme (A) offers a
good ratio
for the space 2:1 but there is not enough space in the stair to clear
the 6'6" door.
Scheme (B) offers space for door clearance but the number does not fit with
Palladio's proportioning system. Any number greater than 22'
dramatically breaks
Palladio's rule for the maximum length of a stairs run (Palladio, A., p.
34).
------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Page 24*
*Reconstructing Palladio’s Villas:*
/*24 */
*6.1.1 Plan Reconstruction *
The plan was reconstructed from the dimensions listed on Palladio's
drawing and the
conjecture defined above (fig. 15). Once the basic layout for the wall
grid along with
dimensions was established (fig.14), and the process of adding
reconstruction begins (fig.
16). The only area of conflict within the plan reconstruction was in the
connection
between the house and the circular barn. It is unclear how the two were
connected in the
Palladio’s drawings. In this solution, the attempt was made to join the
barns to the outer
wall of the main house.
*6.1.2 Elevation Reconstruction*
The elevation did present some problems in height definition, which
varies a lot between
the two barns and the main house. In addition to the variation in
heights of the barns, the
dome became as much of a construction issue as was a design issue. The
dome is drawn
in the /Quattro Libri /with a straight line at its base, where the roof
of the villa meets the
dome, similar to the drawing of the Rotunda. There are no rules for the
height of the
dome, nor rules for its construction. Here again, another conjecture is
made to define the
height of the dome. In this case the guess is set at 72' to the top of
the dome, the same
dimension as the inside radius of the barns (fig. 17).
*6.1.3 Model Construction*
Model construction is broken into 12 parts as mentioned earlier. Here
the main conflict
expected to be resolved in the modeling process is the construction of
the large dome
over the central space. Additional areas are the stair construction,
basements, junction
between barns and the house and the roof of the main house.
*6.1.3.1 Initial Plans *
Although the first level of the plan shows the barns and the basement as
one piece, the
site separates the villa and its into three separate pieces: the
basement, the upper barn and
the lower barn. The walls at the basement of the villa follow the rules
system for walls,
which states that they are to be twice the thickness of the walls at the
*piano noble*.
However, the upper story walls do not follow Palladio's rules tha call
for them to be half
a brick thinner than the *piano noble*. Since the outer wall is flush
and without moldings at
the second level, I constructed them at the same thickness as the *piano
noble* (fig. 18).

*6.1.3.2 Walls *
The floor-to-floor height is missing from the original Palladian drawing
for the piano
noble and the barns. However he does give dimensions for the height of
the walls from
the *piano noble* to the bottom of the roof cornice. Here 17' was given
to the first floor,
one to the floor thickness and 8'-0" was given to the upper story. In
this case the
conjecture for the basement wall height was taken from previous studies
defining the
basement at 11'-0" in height. The barns were given heights of 15' for
the lower barn and
15' for the upper.

/*28 */
*6.1.3.3 Ceilings, vaults and floors *
The only ornate ceiling in the villa is perhaps a barrel vault at the
entry hall. It turns out
that there are two rooms with the possibility of supporting a vaulted
ceiling the entry
room and the small outer room, adjacent the connection to the barns. The
middle space is
a double height space similar to a large palace space with a flat
ceiling. Basement vaults
are semi elliptical vaults (fig. 20).
*6.1.3.4 Cornice *
The cornice is the most complicated part of the assembly. Each cornice
type (c1, c2, etc.)
is composed of three design conditions - an extrusion of the profile, a
cap condition at the
corners where two cornices meet and a reverse cap condition where two
cornices meet in
a corner. Composed of two parts, the Corinthian order is customized in
four different
ways. The first of the Corinthian orders is used for the balcony
projection under the
portico (c2); the second is used at the rotunda (c3), the third is the
most ornate (c4), in
this case placed under the pediment; the last is a flattened version
with the least
ornamentation, and it is used under the roof (c5). The most complicated
connection or
joint is at the portico. Here Palladio extends the ornate entablature
(c4) over the columns
away from the flattened cornice (c5) that surrounds the walls.

*6.1.3.5 Portico and steps *
There are three different portico stairs, each with its own function and
layout. Types (s1)
and (s2) are formal types leading to the porticos of the villa. Types
(s3) and (s5) are
service stairs leading to the upper and or lower barns. Type (s5) is a
formal stair dividing
the two gardens. The greatest conflict is in (s5) which is modeled
differently than
Palladio's original drawing. Palladio's drawings showed a set of stairs
heading into the
lower barns. This gave little room for a landing. The solution here
calls for a switch back
stair leading to the lower barn. The negative part of this is that it is
uncovered.

*6.1.3.6 Staircases *
There are three types of stairs, each made of the standard brick
supporting system, but
there is question as to how the formal stair might have been
constructed. Palladio shows
the stair as a wrapping rectangular stair without an inner wall. It is
not clear how it would
support itself with out a wall so one was added in this study. The
problem is that there is
little room for the door and passageway shown in Palladio’s woodcut.
*6.1.3.7 Columns and arches *
It is unclear as to what orders Palladio might have used for the barns,
and the main villa.
Palladio specifies that the loggias are to be of the Corinthian order
and that the barns are
Tuscan. Bertotti Scamozzi challenges this by saying that the upper barns
were designed
by Palladio to be of the Ionic order and that the lower barns were meant
to be of the
Tuscan. It is most likely that the real challenge of the orders is in
the dome. Palladio does
not assign an order to the half columns in the dome. In the Four Books
he says "/There are /
/some half columns in the hall, that support a gallery, into which one
goes from the rooms/
/above; which by reason they are but seven feet high, serve for mezzati/.

" Bertotti
Scamozzi lists the order under the dome to be Corinthian. I have also
listed the order to
be Corinthian in the documentation, but this will be challenged in the
visualization.

*6.1.3.8 Moldings *
There are two molding types (double and single) surrounding the lower
levels of the villa
and barn.

*8.1.2.9 Doors *
Room doors worked fine when installed by Palladio's rules. The formula
for the principle
doors did not work at the second story. The height of the opening and
archway at the
colonnade had to be altered to compensate for the large entablature.

*Windows*
The generic window size formulated for the villa was also used in the
upper and lower
barns.

*Details *
Here, two principal door types are used, the scroll being the most
formal of the two.
Balustrades and newel post are used at the balcony level.

*Roof and pediment *
The pediment is of the Corinthian type angled at 23.2 degrees, supported
by minor and
major types.

*Results and Conflicts *
As with any reconstruction or design problem, there are major and minor
conflicts and
contradictions that are cause for design invention, in this study there
were two. First,
there are no rules for defining the height of the dome. Although the
villa Rotunda is
rendered with a similar dome, the two cannot be compared in construction
or design. The
Rotunda's dome is drawn almost as if it were metal with little wall
space between the
base of the dome and the top of the villa roof. The Trissino dome has
walls extended far
above the roofline for the main house and the dome has a radius lower
than that of the
Rotunda. Palladio’s drawing shows the Villa Trissino dome with moldings
and details
around the upper portion of the dome, which could mean that the dome was
composed of
brick not metal. The second conflict is over the half columns in the
central space.
Palladio does not specify an order. Scamozzi speculates that the columns
are of the
Corinthian order while Burns defines the order to be Ionic. The two
possible orders are
tested in this next section.

*Interior Studies *
The question here is what was the order of the half columns? The
possibilities include the
Ionic and the Corinthian orders as mentioned by Scamozzi and Burns.
There are two
references that can be taken from other dome spaces similar in
composition to this villa.
The first is the Tempietto Barbaro at Maser, which happens to also have
a portico of the
Corinthian order and a domed space articulated with half columns also in
the Corinthian
order. These half columns support a balcony of thin balustrades, above
with no
supporting newel post. The second space is similar to the design of the
Villa Rotunda,
which is of the Ionic order on the outside and frescos with columns of
no particular order
on the inside. The inner wall below supports the balcony, lined with
balustrades and
newel posts but not columns. Here the two are tested qualitatively.

*Summary of Findings from the Villa Trissino*
The Villa Trissino is a palatial villa of a massive order, set atop a
hill, along side a
beautiful creek, assembled by rule with few conflicts. Here the
conflicts were resolved by
referring to churches or villas of similar design and construction or
resolved through a
closer examination of the physical construction (fig. 15). In spite of
the amount of the
number of issues inspired by each study, each attempt to reconstruct a
villa reveals
unexplored information leading to new questions and new rules. The Villa
Trissino
presented a process and a product more than a particular design finding.
The lesson
learned from this study was that rule conflicts lead to the invention of
new rules (design)
or the rewriting of the existing. Based on information from the past set
of reconstructed
villas (fig. 3) there are fore seen studies that will render many design
conflicts.

*Towards a new Palladian Grammar – Reconstructing the Villas*
As with most computational projects, two areas of learning are at play
between the
computation and the architect. Here, two lessons were learned about
Palladio’s design
process and construction process. First is that Palladio's plan sketches
are spatial
representations from which construction rules can be applied. In other
words, design rules
are represented in the form of lines drawings, while construction rules
are noted by text
and graphics. Second, there are many conflicts and contradictions in the
drawings,
particularly in detailed areas. The drawings were never meant for
construction, they are
meant to serve as simple representations of the villas. The first thing
that must happen is
to convert the plan and elevation to a digital accurate representation
before any three
dimensional rules can be performed. Third lesson is that the rules
actually work in
general terms. Wittkower and Stiny/Mitchell were right. Most rules were
very general
mostly allowing operations on general areas of villa design and
construction. Additional
rules such as wall thickness, ceiling thickness rules, or roof rafter
rules were used to fill
rule gaps.
There were also lessons learned about the reconstruction process as
well. First, is the
issue of evaluation and that resulting materials should be presented and
evaluated under
qualitative and quantitative terms, meaning that the material must be
measurable in scale
and quantity. Architects design spatial material which is best viewed in
three-dimensions
either through rendering or after construction in the form of a
simulated model. Last,
there is always more than one solution to any design problem. Single
solutions can limit
the level of understanding for a particular issue. Multiple variations
of one theme help the
evaluation process by expanding the questions through multiple
representations of the
