Ans.
He seekes not their bloud, as if he could not subsist without that
nourishment, but he often repairs to them, and gets it, the more to
aggravate the Witches damnation, and to put her in mind of her
_Covenant_; and as he is a Spirit and Prince of the ayre, he appeares
to them in any shape whatsoever, which shape is occasioned by him
through joyning of condensed thickned aire together, and many times
doth assume shapes of many creatures; but to create any thing he
cannot do it, it is only proper to God: But in this case of drawing
out of these Teats, he doth really enter into the body, reall,
corporeall, substantiall creature, and forceth that Creature (he
working in it) to his desired ends, and useth the organs of that body
to speake withall to make his compact up with the Witches, be the
creature Cat, Rat, Mouse, &c.

    _When these Paps are fully discovered, yet that will not serve
    sufficiently to convict them, but they must be tortured and kept
    from sleep two or three nights, to distract them, and make them
    say any thing; which is a way to tame a wilde Colt, or Hawke,
    &c._
Ans.
In the infancy of this discovery it was not only thought fitting, but
enjoyned in _Essex_ and _Suffolke_ by the Magistrates, with this
intention only, because they being kept awake would be more the active
to cal their imps in open view the sooner to their helpe, which
oftentimes have so happened; and never or seldome did any Witch ever
complaine in the time of their keeping for want of rest, but after
they had beat their heads together in the Goale; and after this use
was not allowed of by the judges and other Magistrates, it was never
since used, which is a yeare and a halfe since, neither were any kept
from sleep by any order or direction since; but peradventure their own
stubborne wills did not let them sleep, though tendered and offered to
them.
Quer. 9.
    _Beside that unreasonable watching, they were extraordinarily
    walked, till their feet were blistered, and so forced through
    that cruelty to confesse, &c._
Ans.
It was in the same beginning of this discovery, and the meaning of
walking of them at the highest extent of cruelty, was only they to
walke about themselves the night they were watched, only to keepe them
waking: and the reason was this, when they did lye or sit in a chaire,
if they did offer to couch downe, then the watchers were only to
desire them to sit up and walke about, for indeed when they be
suffered so to couch, immediately comes their Familiars into the room
and scareth the watchers, and heartneth on the Witch, though contrary
to the true meaning of the same instructions, diverse have been by
rusticall People, (they hearing them confess to be Witches) mis-used,
spoiled, and abused, diverse whereof have suffered for the same, but
could never be proved against this Discoverer to have a hand in it, or
consent to it; and hath likewise been un-used by him and others, ever
since the time they were kept from sleepe.
Quer. 10.
    _But there hath been an abominable, inhumane, and unmercifull
    tryall of these poore creatures, by tying them, and heaving them
    into the water; a tryall not allowable by Law or conscience, and
    I would faine know the reasons for that._
Ans.
It is not denyed but many were so served as had Papps, and floated,
others that had none were tryed with them and sunk, but marke the
reasons.
For first the Divels policie is great, in perswading many to come of
their own accord to be tryed, perswading them their marks are so close
they shall not be found out, so as diverse have come 10. or 12. Miles
to be searched of their own accord, and hanged for their labour, (as
one _Meggs_ a Baker did, who lived within 7. Miles of _Norwich_, and
was hanged at _Norwich_ Assizes for witchcraft) then when they find
that the Devil tells them false they reflect on him, and he (as 40.
have confessed) adviseth them to be sworne, and tels them they shall
sinke and be cleared that way, then when they be tryed that way and
floate, they see the Devill deceives them againe, and have so laid
open his treacheries.
2. It was never brought in against any of them at their tryals as any
evidence.
3. King _James_ in his _Demonology_ saith, it is a certaine rule, for
(saith he) Witches deny their baptisme when they Covenant with the
Devill, water being the sole element thereof, and therefore saith he,
when they be heaved into the water, the water refuseth to receive them
into her bosome, (they being such Miscreants to deny their baptisme)
and suffers them to float, as the Froath on the Sea, which the water
will not recieve, but casts it up and downe till it comes to the
earthy element the shore, and there leaves it to consume.
4. Observe these generation of Witches, if they be at any time abused
by being called Whore, Theefe, &c, by any where they live, they are
the readiest to cry and wring their hands, and shed tears in abundance
& run with full and right sorrowfull acclamations to some Justice of
the Peace, and with many teares make their complaints: but now behold
their stupidity; nature or the elements reflection from them, when
they are accused for this horrible and damnable sin of Witchcraft,
they never alter or change their countenances nor let one Teare fall.
This by the way, swimming (by able Divines whom I reverence) is
condemned for no way, and therefore of late hath, and for ever shall
be left.

    _Oh! but if this torturing Witch-catcher can by all or any of
    these meanes wring out a word or two of confession from any of
    these stupified, ignorant, unitelligible, poore silly creatures,
    (though none heare it but himselfe) he will adde and put her in
    feare to confesse telling her, else she shall be hanged; but if
    she doe, he will set her at liberty, and so put a word into her
    mouth, and make such a silly creature confesse she knowes not
    what._
Answ.
He is of a better conscience, and for your better understanding of
him, he doth thus uncase himselfe to all, add declares what
confessions (though made by a Witch against her selfe) he allowes not
of, and doth altogether account of no validity, or worthy of credence
to be given to it, and ever did so account it, and ever likewise
shall.
1. He utterly denyes that confession of a Witch to be of any validity,
when it is drawn from her by any torture or violence whatsoever;
although after watching, walking, or swimming, diverse have suffered,
yet peradventure Magistrates with much care and diligence did solely
and fully examine them after sleepe, and consideration sufficient.
2. He utterly denyes that confession of a Witch, which is drawn from
her by flattery, viz. _if you will confess you shall go home, you
shall not go to the Goale, nor be hanged, &c._
3. He utterly denyes that confession of a Witch, when she confesseth
any improbability, impossibility, as _flying in the ayre, riding on a
broom, &c._
4. He utterly denyes a confession of a Witch, when it is interrogated
to her, and words put into her mouth, to be of any force or effect: as
to say to a silly (yet Witch wicked enough) _you have foure Imps have
you not_? She answers affirmatively, Yes: _did they not suck you_?
Yes, saith she: _Are not their names so, and so_? Yes, saith shee;
_Did not you send such an Impe to kill my child_? Yes saith she, this
being all her confession after this manner, it is by him accompted
nothing, and he earnestly doth desire that all Magistrates and Jurors
would a little more then ever they did examine witnesses about the
interrogated confessions.
Quer. 12.
    _If all those confessions be denyed, I wonder what he will make
    confession, for sure it is, all these wayes have been used and
    took for good confessions, and many have suffered for them, and
    I know not what, he will then make confession._
Answ.
Yes, in brief he will declare what confession of a Witch is of
validity and force in his judgement, to hang a Witch: when a Witch is
first found with teats, then sequestred from her house, which is onely
to keep her old associates from her, and so by good counsell brought
into a sad condition, by understanding of the horribleness of her sin,
and the judgements threatned against her; and knowing the Devils
malice and subtile circumventions, is brought to remorse and sorrow
for complying with Satan so long, and disobeying Gods sacred Commands,
doth then desire to unfold her mind with much bitterness, and then
without any of the before-mentioned hard usages or questions put to
her, doth of her owne accord declare what was the occasion of the
Devils appearing to her, whether ignorance, pride, anger, malice, &c.
was predominant over her, she doth then declare what speech they had,
what likeness he was in, what voice be had, what familiars he sent
her, what number of spirits, what names they had, what shape they were
in, what imployment she set them about to severall persons in severall
places, (unknowne to the hearers) all which mischiefes being proved to
be done, at the same time she confessed to the same parties for the
same cause, and all effected, is testimony enough again her for all
her denyall.
Quest. 13.
    _How can any possibly beleeve that the Devill and the Witch
    joyning together, should have such power, as the Witches
    confesse to kill such such a man, child, horse, cow, the like;
    if we beleeve they can doe what they will, then we derogate from
    Gods power, who for certaine limits the Devill and the Witch;
    and I cannot beleeve they have any power at all._
Answ.
God suffers the Devill many times to doe much hurt, and the devill
doth play many times the deluder and impostor with these Witches, in
perswading them that they are the cause of such and such a murder
wrought by him with their consents, when and indeed neither he nor
they had any hand in it, as thus: We must needs argue, he is of a
long standing, above 6000. yeers, then he must needs be the best
Scholar in all knowledges of arts and tongues, & so have the best
skill in _Physicke_, judgment in _Physiognomie_, and knowledge of what
disease is reigning or predominant in this or that mans body, (and so
for cattell too) by reason of his long experience. This subtile
tempter knowing such a man lyable to some sudden disease, (as by
experience I have found) as _Plurisie_, _Imposthume_, &c. he resorts
to divers Witches; if they know the man, and seek to make a difference
between the Witches and the party, it may be by telling them he hath
threatned to have them very shortly searched, and so hanged for
Witches, then they all consult with _Satan_ to save themselves, and
_Satan_ stands ready prepared, with a _What will you have me doe for
you, my deare and nearest children, covenanted and compacted with me
in my hellish league, and sealed with your blood, my delicate
firebrand-darlings_.
[Sidenote: _The Divells speech to the Witches._]
Oh thou (say they) that at the first didst promise to save us thy
servants from any of out deadly enemies discovery, and didst promise
to avenge and flay all those, we pleased, that did offend us; Murther
that wretch suddenly who threatens the down-fall of your loyall
subjects. He then promiseth to effect it. Next newes is heard the
partie is dead, he comes to the witch, and gets a world of reverence,
credence and respect for his power and activeness, when and indeed the
disease kills the party, not the Witch, nor the Devill, (onely the
Devill knew that such a disease was predominant) and the witch
aggravates her damnation by her familiarity and consent to the Devill,
and so comes likewise in compass of the Lawes. This is Satans usuall
impostring and deluding, but not his constant course of proceeding,
for he and the witch doe mischiefe too much. But I would that
Magistrates and Jurats would a little examine witnesses when they
heare witches confess such and such a murder, whether the party had
not long time before, or at the time when the witch grew suspected,
some disease or other predominant, which might cause that issue or
effect of death.
Quer. 14.
    _All that the witch-finder doth is to fleece the country of
    their money, and therefore rides and goes to townes to have
    imployment, and promiseth them faire promises, and it may be
    doth nothing for it, and possesseth many men that they have so
    many wizzards and so many witches in their towne, and so hartens
    them on to entertaine him._
Ans.
You doe him a great deale of wrong in every of these particulars. For,
first,
1. He never went to any towne or place, but they rode, writ, or sent
often for him, and were (for ought he knew) glad of him.
2. He is a man that doth disclaime that ever he detected a witch, or
said, Thou art a witch; only after her tryall by search, and their
owne confessions, he as others may judge.
3. Lastly, judge how he fleeceth the Country, and inriches himselfe,
by considering the vast summe he takes of every towne, he demands but
20.s. a town, & doth sometimes ride 20. miles for that, & hath no more
for all his charges thither and back again (& it may be stayes a weeke
there) and finde there 3. or 4. witches, or if it be but one, cheap
enough, and this is the great summe he takes to maintaine his Companie
with 3. horses.
